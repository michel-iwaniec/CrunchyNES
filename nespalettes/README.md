# Default palette file for CrunchyBuild

This palette contains the fallback RGB -> NES PPU color mapping used by CrunchyBuild if no other is specified.

It's been generated from the initial values of Drag's NES Palette Generator at http://drag.wootest.net/misc/palgen.html

It also contains a 256-color / 768-byte version. This is the same file padded with zeros, and is useful for pixel art programs that will only load palettes of exactly 768 bytes.
